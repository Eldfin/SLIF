    Copied from SLIX:

    Generate a 2D colorized direction image in the HSV color space based on
    the original direction. Value and saturation of the color will always be
    one. The hue is determined by the direction.

    If the direction parameter is only a 2D np array, the result will be
    a simple orientation map where each pixel contains the HSV value
    corresponding to the direction angle.

    When a 3D stack with max. three directions is used, the result will be
    different. The resulting image will have two times the width and height.
    Each 2x2 square will show the direction angle of up to three directions.
    Depending on the number of directions, the following pattern is used to
    show the different direction angles.

    1 direction:

        1 1
        1 1

    2 directions:

        1 2
        2 1

    3 directions:

        1 2
        3 0

    Args:

        direction: 2D or 3D np array containing the direction of the image
                   stack

        inclination: Optional inclination of the image in degrees. If none is set, an inclination of 0Â° is assumed.

        saturation: Weight image by using the saturation value. Use either a 2D image
                    or a 3D image with the same shape as the direction. If no image
                    is used, the saturation for all image pixels will be set to 1

        value:  Weight image by using the value. Use either a 2D image
                or a 3D image with the same shape as the direction. If no image
                is used, the value for all image pixels will be set to 1

        colormap: The colormap to use. Default is HSV black. The available color maps
                  can be found in the colormap class.

        direction_offset: Direction offset in degree (default: 0). This will
        change the coloring of the vectors.
